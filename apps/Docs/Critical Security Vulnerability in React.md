Overview
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It offers an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, and is widely used in web applications and server-side development.

‍

A Path Traversal vulnerability has been identified in Node.js on Windows. An incomplete fix has been identified for CVE-2025-23084 in Node.js, specifically affecting Windows device names like CON, PRN, and AUX.
This vulnerability affects Windows users of path.join API.

‍

This vulnerability affects specific versions of the package and can result in Path Traversal. Details on affected versions and reproduction steps are provided below.

December 06, 7:29 AM PST: An npm package has been released to update affected Next.js apps. Use npx fix-react2shell-next to update now, or visit the GitHub repository to learn more.

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the React Server Components (RSC) protocol. The issue is rated CVSS 10.0 and can allow remote code execution when processing attacker-controlled requests in unpatched environments.

This vulnerability originates in the upstream React implementation (CVE-2025-55182). This advisory (CVE-2025-66478) tracks the downstream impact on Next.js applications using the App Router.

Impact
The vulnerable RSC protocol allowed untrusted inputs to influence server-side execution behavior. Under specific conditions, an attacker could craft requests that trigger unintended server execution paths. This can result in remote code execution in unpatched environments.

Affected Next.js Versions
Applications using React Server Components with the App Router are affected when running:

Next.js 15.x
Next.js 16.x
Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases
Next.js 13.x, Next.js 14.x stable, Pages Router applications, and the Edge Runtime are not affected.

Fixed Versions
The vulnerability is fully resolved in the following patched Next.js releases:

15.0.5
15.1.9
15.2.6
15.3.6
15.4.8
15.5.7
16.0.7
We also released patched canary releases for Next.js 15 and 16:

15.6.0-canary.58 (for 15.x canary releases)
16.1.0-canary.12 (for 16.x canary releases)
These versions include the hardened React Server Components implementation.

Required Action
All users should upgrade to the latest patched version in their release line:

Terminal
npm install next@15.0.5 # for 15.0.x
npm install next@15.1.9 # for 15.1.x
npm install next@15.2.6 # for 15.2.x
npm install next@15.3.6 # for 15.3.x
npm install next@15.4.8 # for 15.4.x
npm install next@15.5.7 # for 15.5.x
npm install next@16.0.7 # for 16.0.x

npm install next@15.6.0-canary.58 # for 15.x canary releases
npm install next@16.1.0-canary.12 # for 16.x canary releases
If you are on Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 or a later canary release, downgrade to the latest stable 14.x release:

Terminal
npm install next@14
If you're currently using canary releases to enable PPR, you can update to 15.6.0-canary.58, which includes a fix for the vulnerability while continuing to support PPR. For other ways to patch older versions, see this discussion post.

Run npx fix-react2shell-next to launch an interactive tool which can check versions and perform deterministic version bumps per the recommended versions above. See the GitHub repository for full details.

Terminal
npx fix-react2shell-next
There is no workaround—upgrading to a patched version is required.

Discovery
Thank you to Lachlan Davidson for discovering and responsibly disclosing this vulnerability. We are intentionally limiting technical detail in this advisory to protect developers who have not yet upgraded.

Critical Security Vulnerability in React Server Components
December 3, 2025 by The React Team

There is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components.

We recommend upgrading immediately.

On November 29th, Lachlan Davidson reported a security vulnerability in React that allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.

Even if your app does not implement any React Server Function endpoints it may still be vulnerable if your app supports React Server Components.

This vulnerability was disclosed as CVE-2025-55182 and is rated CVSS 10.0.

The vulnerability is present in versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 of:

react-server-dom-webpack
react-server-dom-parcel
react-server-dom-turbopack
Immediate Action Required
A fix was introduced in versions 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1. If you are using any of the above packages please upgrade to any of the fixed versions immediately.

If your app’s React code does not use a server, your app is not affected by this vulnerability. If your app does not use a framework, bundler, or bundler plugin that supports React Server Components, your app is not affected by this vulnerability.

Affected frameworks and bundlers
Some React frameworks and bundlers depended on, had peer dependencies for, or included the vulnerable React packages. The following React frameworks & bundlers are affected: next, react-router, waku, @parcel/rsc, @vitejs/plugin-rsc, and rwsdk.

We will update this post with upgrade instructions on how to upgrade as they become available.

Hosting Provider Mitigations
We have worked with a number of hosting providers to apply temporary mitigations.

You should not depend on these to secure your app, and still update immediately.

Vulnerability overview
React Server Functions allow a client to call a function on a server. React provides integration points and tools that frameworks and bundlers use to help React code run on both the client and the server. React translates requests on the client into HTTP requests which are forwarded to a server. On the server, React translates the HTTP request into a function call and returns the needed data to the client.

An unauthenticated attacker could craft a malicious HTTP request to any Server Function endpoint that, when deserialized by React, achieves remote code execution on the server. Further details of the vulnerability will be provided after the rollout of the fix is complete.

Update Instructions
Next.js
All users should upgrade to the latest patched version in their release line:

npm install next@15.0.5 // for 15.0.x
npm install next@15.1.9 // for 15.1.x
npm install next@15.2.6 // for 15.2.x
npm install next@15.3.6 // for 15.3.x
npm install next@15.4.8 // for 15.4.x
npm install next@15.5.7 // for 15.5.x
npm install next@16.0.7 // for 16.0.x
If you are on Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 or a later canary release, downgrade to the latest stable 14.x release:

npm install next@14
See the Next.js changelog for more info.

React Router

npm install react@latest
npm install react-dom@latest
npm install react-server-dom-parcel@latest
